1) Difference between var, let, and const

var â†’ Old way. Function-scoped. Can be re-declared and updated.

let â†’ Modern way. Block-scoped. Can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.

const â†’ Block-scoped. Cannot be re-assigned (value fixed), but objects/arrays inside can still change.

ðŸ‘‰ Use let for values that change, const for fixed ones.

2) Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()

forEach() â†’ Just loops through array items. Doesnâ€™t return anything.

map() â†’ Loops and creates a new array by transforming items.

filter() â†’ Loops and creates a new array with only items that pass a condition.

ðŸ‘‰ forEach = only looping, map = transform, filter = select.

3) Arrow functions in ES6

A shorter way to write functions.

Example:

// Normal function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function
const add = (a, b) => a + b;


They donâ€™t have their own this, which makes them useful in callbacks.

4) Destructuring assignment in ES6

A way to unpack values from arrays or objects into variables.

Example:

// Array destructuring
const [a, b] = [10, 20]; 
console.log(a); // 10
console.log(b); // 20

// Object destructuring
const person = {name: "Nazmul", age: 26};
const {name, age} = person;
console.log(name); // Nazmul
console.log(age);  // 26

5) Template literals in ES6

Strings written with backticks (`).

Allow multiline strings and easy variable embedding.

Example:

let name = "Nazmul";
let msg = `Hello, ${name}! How are you?`;
console.log(msg); // Hello, Nazmul! How are you?


âœ… Difference from string concatenation:

Concatenation uses + â†’ "Hello " + name + "!"

Template literals use ${} â†’ much cleaner & readable.
